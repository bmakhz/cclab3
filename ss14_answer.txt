Yes, there are alternative commands to delete Docker images completely in one go:

1. Delete image by Image ID (removes all tags at once):
   docker rmi <image_id>
   Example: docker rmi 2bc1d45bf247
   This deletes the image along with all tags pointing to the same image ID.

2. Force delete image (even if containers exist):
   docker rmi -f <image_name>
   This forcefully removes the image even if containers are using it.

3. Remove all unused images:
   docker image prune -a
   This removes all images that are not being used by any container.

4. Remove multiple images at once:
   docker rmi <image1> <image2> <image3>
   Example: docker rmi spam-web-app hello-world python:3.10-slim

5. Remove all images (dangerous - removes everything):
   docker rmi $(docker images -q)
   This deletes all Docker images from the system.

The most efficient method to delete an image with multiple tags is to use the Image ID directly (method 1), as it removes all tags associated with that image in a single command.
